## Limitations & Assumptions
- Value will be rounded to 2 decimal points with values 0.XX5 and above being rounded up and values 0.XX4 and below being rounded down
- The programme will accept numerical values between $0.01 and $999,999,999.99
- The "first digit" in a number is the right most value as this is how it is processed
